# 🌞 Advanced Solar System Simulator

**Advanced Solar System Simulator** is a 3D, comprehensive Solar System simulator developed using Python and VPython. It provides a realistic astronomical experience, allowing users to observe planets’ sizes, orbits, and rotation speeds accurately.  
💻 **Note:** The application is accessible via the web.

## 🎮 Features

- **Realistic 3D Simulation:**  
  - Correctly scaled sizes of the Sun and 8 planets with accurate surface textures.  
  - Planets rotate around their axes and orbit the Sun at realistic speeds.  
  - Time is scaled: 1 year = 0.000001 Earth years.

- **Planet Selection Buttons:**  
  - From left to right: `Solar System`, `Earth`, `Mercury`, `Venus`, `Mars`, `Jupiter`, `Saturn`, `Uranus`, `Neptune`, `Moon`.  
  - The selected button is highlighted in green and displays the corresponding planet or system.

- **Orbit and Pause Controls:**  
  - `Orbit: No / Orbit: Yes`: Toggle the display of planet and moon orbits.  
  - `Pause / Run`: Stop or start the simulation.

- **Information Labels:**  
  - Navigation instructions: `"Middle Click = Zoom    Right Click = Move"`.  
  - Planetary and system time indicators:  
    - Example: `Solar System -> Year: 0  (1 Year = 0.000001 Earth Year)`  
    - Example: `Earth -> Day: 0  (1 Day = 0.0001 Earth Day)`  
  - Values are calculated mathematically to simulate realistic time progression.

- **Language Support:**  
  - Switch the interface between `Turkish` and `English` using the corresponding buttons.

- **Sound Control:**  
  - `<)` button to manage audio:  
    - `<)` normal volume  
    - `<))` increased volume  
    - `<` mute  
    - Clicking again resets to `<)`.

- **Immersive Experience:**  
  - Simulates the view as if observing planets from an astronaut's perspective.  
  - Relative planet sizes, surface textures, and rotation/orbit speeds are realistic.  
  - Axial tilts are currently under development.

## 💡 Notes

- The simulation is based on real-time astronomical calculations.  
- Time units such as 1 year or 1 day are scaled for the simulation.  
- Axial tilts and advanced visualizations are still in progress.
